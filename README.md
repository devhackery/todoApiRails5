# README

This is my workshop project in rails 5 with api only.


* Ruby version : ruby 2.3.3p222


* Token-based authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). In this implementation, we'll proceed with our approach of using TDD principles to add the authentication features.

* Versioning,Serializers,Pagination

API will expose the following RESTful endpoints.

Endpoint	Functionality
POST /signup	Signup
POST /auth/login	Login
GET /auth/logout	Logout
GET /todos	List all todos
POST /todos	Create a new todo
GET /todos/:id	Get a todo
PUT /todos/:id	Update a todo
DELETE /todos/:id	Delete a todo and its items
GET /todos/:id/items	Get a todo item
PUT /todos/:id/items	Update a todo item
DELETE /todos/:id/items	Delete a tod
